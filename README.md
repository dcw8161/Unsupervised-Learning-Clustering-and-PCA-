# Unsupervised-Learning (Clustering and PCA) 
Unsupervised learning was done using Clustering and Principal component analysis  (PCA)

## Clustering Method
- Clustering, also known as cluster analysis, organizes and classifies data points into groups or clusters
- It falls under unsupervised learning, where we donâ€™t have a target variable
- The goal is to group similar data points together based on a similarity metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity)

  ### Types of Clustering
  - Hard Clustering: Each data point belongs to a cluster completely
  - Soft Clustering: Probabilities of data points belonging to different clusters are evaluated

  ### Use Cases of Clustering
  - Market Segmentation: Businesses use clustering for customer segmentation and targeted advertisements
  - Medical Imaging: Detecting unknown or new infected areas
  - Pattern Recognition
  - Image Analysis
  - Social Network Analysis
