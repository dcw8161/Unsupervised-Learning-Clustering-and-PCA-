# Unsupervised-Learning (Clustering and PCA) 
Unsupervised learning was done using Clustering and Principal component analysis (PCA)

## Clustering Method
- Clustering, also known as cluster analysis, organizes and classifies data points into groups or clusters
- It falls under unsupervised learning, where we donâ€™t have a target variable
- The goal is to group similar data points together based on a similarity metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity)

  ### Types of Clustering
  - Hard Clustering: Each data point belongs to a cluster completely
  - Soft Clustering: Probabilities of data points belonging to different clusters are evaluated

  ### Use Cases of Clustering
  - Market Segmentation: Businesses use clustering for customer segmentation and targeted advertisements
  - Medical Imaging: Detecting unknown or new infected areas
  - Pattern Recognition
  - Image Analysis
  - Social Network Analysis

## Principal component analysis (PCA)
This is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets. 

  ### Purpose of PCA:
  - Dimentionaly Reduction: 


  ### How PCA Works:
    - PCA identifies orthogonal axes (principal components) that retain essential information
    - The first principal component explains the most variance, followed by the second, and so on
    - By selecting a subset of these components, we reduce the dimensionality while preserving patterns


  ### Applications of PCA:
    - Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand data structure and relationships
    - Feature Engineering: Improve model performance by reducing noise
    - Visualization: Plot data in lower dimensions for better insights
